q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The diff report showed the changes made in the two versions of the file.
The highlighted differences help me to how a bug was introduced in the later version.
Most changes were fine - they were just code documentation.
However, one of the changes was to an conditional statement where the wrong variable name was used. This was the bug!
